I am a Ph.D. candidate in Econometrics and Quantitative Economics at Colorado State University. My research focuses on agricultural production economics, natural resource economics, and environmental economics, with a strong foundation in applied econometrics. My work bridges economic theory and practical applications, particularly in the context of agricultural conservation and trade.
