## About Me

I am a Junior Research Economist with the Agricultural Risk Policy Center at North Dakota State University. 
My research centers on agricultural conservation policy, trade, and climate change, with particular attention to how policy incentives and global market forces influence land use, rural employment, and greenhouse gas mitigation.
Through my work, I aim to provide empirical insights that inform policy decisions, balancing rural economic development, international competitiveness, and environmental stewardship, and contributing to the development of sustainable agricultural systems.
