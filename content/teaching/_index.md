        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Throughout my graduate studies at Colorado State University, teaching has played a pivotal role in my academic development. My diverse teaching portfolio includes leading a remote undergraduate course in Agricultural and Resource Economics during the COVID-19 pandemic, developing a new curriculum for Agricultural Data Management and Analysis for early-year undergraduates, and creating an R programming Code Camp for incoming graduate students. As an instructor, my goal is to build studentsâ€™ knowledge of economics concepts, equip them with essential analytic tools for understanding the world around them, and, more importantly, engage them in evidence-based policy-making processes. There are three principles I embrace in teaching and incorporate into all of my interactions with students:</span>
        
        <ul>
        <li><span style="font-size: 16px;">Student-centered personalized learning</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 16px;">Active and inclusive learning</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 16px;">Application and real-world connections</span></li>
        </ul>
