abstract: "China is a large vegetable producing country and also a vegetable export super power in the world. In 2002, China and ASEAN countries signed an agreement to jointly establish the largest free trade area in developing countries, which will serve the largest population in the world. On the basis of analyzing the status quo of China’s ASEAN vegetable export trade, this paper empirically analyzed the influencing factors of China’s ASEAN vegetable export trade by constructing an extended gravity model. The main conclusion of this study is that total GDP of both trading countries, geographical distance, CAFTA trade environment, and each country’s vegetable per unit yield (production technology), etc., had significant impact on vegetable export trade between China and ASEAN countries. The paper also analyzed the trade prospects of China’s vegetable export to ASEAN countries in the future by trade potential measurement, and provided relevant countermeasures and suggestions."
