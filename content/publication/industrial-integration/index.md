abstract: This research studies the factors that affect farmers' choice of different vegetable industry integration modes from the perspective of farmers. Based on the transaction cost theory, this article classifies the basic production and management characteristics of farmers, and constructs three major cost evaluating indicators including anti-risk, execution, negotiation. The multi-logistic model was used to analyze the main influencing factors of farmers' choice of different vegetable industry integration modes. The results show that the vegetable industry integration can mainly be divided into the "Wholesale Market Mode", the "Farmers-Consumers Mode", the "Farmers-Supermarkets Docking Mode", and the "Order Agriculture Mode". In addition,the "Wholesale Market Mode",is still the most important vegetable industry integration mode. The characteristics of farmers' basic production and management affect their choice of different vegetable industry integration modes to varying degrees. And the most critical influencing factor is transaction cost, but the impact of anti-risk cost, execution cost and negotiation cost on different vegetable industry integration modes is very different.
